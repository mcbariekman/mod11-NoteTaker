# Note Taker App

The Note Taker app is a note-taking application designed to simplify the process of capturing, managing, and organizing your notes. It provides a straightforward interface with a landing page that includes a link to access the notes page. On the notes page, you can view existing notes in the left-hand column and create new notes by entering a title and corresponding text. Saving a new note is as simple as clicking a button, and it appears alongside your other notes. You can also view, edit, and delete any note by selecting it from the list. The Write icon in the navigation bar allows you to quickly create a new note with empty fields.
